The Vision and Language Group, ACM IIT Roorkee Chapter, is a student run group which aims to foster an on-campus research-centric Deep Learning community. The group was formed in 2017 to provide a platform to meet and discuss Deep Learning research papers. The group has since then evolved into a group that focuses on both the theoretical and practical knowledge of Deep Learning. Theoretical aspects are covered in campus-open discussions and brainstorming sessions of recent and renowned Deep Learning papers, while practical applications of ideas include research projects and and paper implementations, so as to have a robust understanding of the field. The group works towards developing the research capabilities of the students in the campus, so that students wanting to pursue research after their degree have a strong foundation to stand on.
