### Biography

Hey! I am Huzaib, currently a pre-final yearite at IIT Roorkee. I'm interested in Generative modeling, natural language processing, self-supervised learning, and the list is getting longer with time. I do not believe in making long-term plans and hence I'm not sure where I'll end up but I do keep the fight clean😋.

Turned into a serious MMA fan from the last couple of years. I'm always open to having UFC discussions. I play cricket casually with friends and love mind-wobbling movies. Also addicted to Michael Jackson's pop somehow😝.
