abstract = "Training high-performing large language models (LLMs) from scratch is an expensive and complex task. Model merging techniques offer a more computationally efficient alternative, where pretrained LLMs are fine-tuned on specific tasks and then combined to produce a versatile model capable of handling a broad range of tasks, including reasoning, coding, mathematics, conversation, and tool usage. Unlike traditional fine-tuning or ensemble methods, our approach to merging is less computationally intensive. We represent each fine-tuned model with a \"Task Vector\" relative to a pretrained \"Base LLM\" , derived from the LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) weights of the fine-tuned models. By computing the geometric median of these task vectors in high-dimensional space using Weiszfeldâ€™s iterative algorithm and adding it to the \"Base LLM\" weights, we create a unified model that generalizes effectively across tasks. This efficient method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests while reducing computational demands"
